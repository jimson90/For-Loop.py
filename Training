#Hello, today I will be trying to master to the concept of For Loops in python. Thanks


#Training 1

Gym = ["Barbell", "Dumbell", "Treadmill", "Stairmaster", "Basketball", "Pullup Bar"]
for i in Gym:
  print(i)
  
#This for loop will print out the list under the variable name "Gym"


#Training 2

Gym = ["Barbell", "Dumbell", "Treadmill", "Stairmaster", "Basketball", "Pullup Bar"]
for i in Gym:
  if i == "Treadmill":
    break
  print(i)
    
#Using a break statement to stop the Looping cycle


#Training 3

Gym = ["Barbell", "Dumbell", "Treadmill", "Stairmaster", "Basketball", "Pullup Bar"]
for i in Gym:
  if i == "Treadmill":
    continue
  print(i)
  
#Using a continue statement to skip over the word "Treadmill"

#Training 4

for p in range(10):
  print(p)
  
#Utlizing the range function in the for loop to print out numbers 0 to 9


#Training 5

for o in range(10,20):
  print(o)
  
#This will print 10 to 19


#Training 6

for u in range(10,20,2):
  print(u)
  
#This will print in increments of 2 (10,12,14.....)


#Training 7

for j in range(17):
  print(j)
else:
  print("Finished")

#This will print out 0-16. When the looping is done it will print out "Finished". Using an Else keyword.
